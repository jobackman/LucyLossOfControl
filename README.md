# LucyLossOfControl
_Prettifies Blizzard's standard Loss of Control UI Frame in WoW_

It doesnt remove or add any spells that trigger the frame, it simply restyles the look of Blizzard's Loss of Control UI to be more minimalistic.

It:

- Hides the red background glow-effect
- Hides the duration text
- Repositions the spell icon to the center of the screen
- Repositions the spell effect name to be centered below the icon
